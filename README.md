# VisiOCR

Revolutionizing Visitor Management with OCR Technology Project Overview VisiOCR is an innovative solution that automates the process of issuing visiting passes by extracting relevant information from UIDAI or PAN cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This project aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and security in visitor management systems across various organizations and facilities.

Modules The project consists of the following modules: Image Capture Module: Captures images of UIDAI or PAN cards 

1.OCR Integration Module: Integrates OCR technology to extract relevant information. 

2.Data Extraction Module: Extracts relevant information from the captured images. 

3.Data Validation Module: Validates the extracted data for accuracy and completeness. 

4.Visiting Pass Generation Module: Generates visiting passes based on the validated data.

Goals The primary goals of VisiOCR are to: Enhance efficiency in visitor management systems. Improve accuracy in data extraction and validation. Strengthen security measures in visitor management systems.
